# Merkurkit

[Kirby CMS](https://getkirby.com/) Starter Kit with aims to be as minimal, maintainable and longlasting as possible. Conservative choices for buildproces (esbuild and postcss), only npm scripts. Public folder Kirby setup and some base starter stuff and basic TailwindCSS config. Flexible and easily to change (like deleting Tailwind or with UnoCSS).

[Karsten Systems](https://karsten.systems) have been using build process like this for more than 3 years so some longetivity is there.

[Kirby School](https://kirby.school) has video series that explains and builds this Kit. Actually the v0 of this kit is the code from the series.


Merkur will be Kirby Block based theme but first i needed this kit. It's named after [Toy manufacturer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merkur_%28toy%29) not Mercury (planet).
